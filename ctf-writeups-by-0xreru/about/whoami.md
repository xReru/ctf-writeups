Hey there 👋 I’m **0xreru**, a Computer Science student from the Philippines.

I like tinkering with things until they break — and sometimes even after they’re broken, just to see if they’ll break _again_.

I also enjoy making people lazy. If I can automate it, script it, or find a shortcut, you bet I will.

So grab your energy drink, stretch your brain, and join me as I document my victories, fails, and occasional moments of _“oh wait, that actually worked?”_

I’m part of **LilPwny** CTF Team — Most of my writeups here are personal notes, but some come from adventures with the crew.
