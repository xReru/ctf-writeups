Welcome to my digital dumpster of hacks, fails, and “wait… that actually worked?” moments.

👾 Name’s **Oxreru** — Computer Science student, 🇵🇭 based, caffeine-dependent lifeform.\

#### 🗂 Contents of this cursed repo

* **picoCTF** — baby’s first hacks, except baby has `rm -rf` access.
* **OverTheWire** — aka “Linux: Elden Ring Edition.”
* **CryptoHack** — where math tries to kill me but I XOR back harder.
* **Misc** — random hacks, cursed scripts, and notes I probably should not admit publicly.

#### 💡 Mission statement (kinda)

To document my questionable methods, make future-me facepalm, and maybe help you grab a flag or two while laughing at my pain.

Remember:

> “It’s not a bug, it’s a **CTF feature™**.”

Grab your 🍕, open Burp, and let’s get this bread (or flag).

⚠️ Warning: Side effects may include increased laziness, sudden urge to `strings` literally everything, and random `segfaults` in real life.
